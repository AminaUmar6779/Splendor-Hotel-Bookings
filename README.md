## Data Analysis
Lead Time: From our analysis we can see that the reservations made within one month resulted to a total of 175 while the reservations made over one month in advance accounted for a total of 859. So this shows that reservations mae within one month are less likely to be cancelled.

Cancellation Rate: From our analysis, cancellation rates were higher in the summer months (Jun-Aug) and lower in the winter months (Dec-Feb) for both 2015 and 2016. This could be due to factors like weather or tourism trends.

Average Daily Rate Trends: Our analysis shows that the average daily rate appears to follow a similar seasonal trend to cancellation rates, with higher rates in the summer and lower rates in the winter. This suggests that hotels raise prices during peak.

Year over Year Trends: Our analysis shows that cancellation rates may be slightly lower in 2016 compared to 2015. Average daily rates also seem to be lower in 2016 compared to 2015.

Sum of Revenue and Revenue Loss: Our analysis shows that high cancellation rate cost nearly $1M in Revenue losses last year 2016 during July showing that reservations booked with more than one month in advance are causing most of the revenue loss.

## Recommendations
Replace the bookings that are made in advance which are more likely to be cancelled with bookings that have a lesser risk of cancellations.

Consider overbooking by a higher percentage for room types that historically have higher cancellation rates.

Some regions may have regulations on overbooking. Be sure to research and comply with any applicable regulations.

Consider giving discounts during the summer time as people travel alot during the summer, the discounts will attract more people which will boost the revenue.

Consider bundle packages especially for families that have children. Include amenities that children will enjoy.
